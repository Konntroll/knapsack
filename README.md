This is a solution to a variant of the knapsack problem

This solution (solution\solution.php) is implemented in PHP and is designed to solve the problem with any number of options of any value/weight, either with or without a limit imposed upon the number of elements to be used.

By default, the program solves the problem for a set range of options with a limit of four elements or less per solution and issues an error message if no solution fits within the limit.

However, a few test cases (implemented in test\autoTest.php using PHPUnit(not included)) with varying inputs are also employed to demostrate the flexibility of this solution.
